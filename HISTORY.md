# History

## v4.1.0 2020 October 29

-   Updated dependencies, [base files](https://github.com/bevry/base), and [editions](https://editions.bevry.me) using [boundation](https://github.com/bevry/boundation)

## v4.0.0 2020 October 27

-   Changed engines from Node.js `>=0.8` to `>=4`, as supporting versions that we cannot test against is too fragile
    -   We are still generating the same code, using the `ES5` compile target, so perhaps it still works, however we cannot and will not guarantee compatibility for Node.js versions earlier than v4

-   Updated dependencies, [base files](https://github.com/bevry/base), and [editions](https://editions.bevry.me) using [boundation](https://github.com/bevry/boundation)

## v3.0.0 2020 May 13

-   Support node >= 0.8 but test only against node >= 10
    -   We are still generating the same code, using ES5 compile target, so support remains the same
    -   However, testing ecosystem have been upgrading to node >= 10, as such unless all testing packages also function on node >= 0.8, which is possible but highly inconvenient then tests cannot run on such versions
